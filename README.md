## Why Soju?

Soju fetches and plays data from Spotify.

- âœ… Quickly see and sample the album a track is from
  - Preview all of them, and only add the songs you like to Spotify
  - Share Spotify music samples easily with friends using Apple Music, YouTube Music, etc.
- âœ… Quickly preview songs in an album/playlist
  - No more interrupting your current queue
  - No more clicking to the middle of a song for the good stuff
- âœ… Quickly compare songs between other albums/playlists
  - No more waiting for pages to load as you're jumping around, when you just want to hear samples quickly

Soju does NOT:

- ðŸš« Play music from YouTube
  - Many "Spotify players" only fetch data from Spotify and play the song (often wrong or a copycat) through YouTube. This ruins quality, immersion, and originality. Soju is my promise to you that only the original Spotify data direct from the source will be displayed.
- ðŸš« Stream full music tracks
  - Soju was made for music samples only, because there are already FOSS Spotify clients and FOSS Spotify-to-YouTube clients that exist. I do not wish to reinvent the wheel.
